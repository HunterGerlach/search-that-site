# search-that-site

## Description
I found myself constantly searching the same sites over and over again, but those sites had terrible search tools. Instead of continuing down this painful path, I began to append the `site:` operator to my searches to get the best of both worlds. The extra typing eventually became too time consuming, so I made this extention.

## Instructions
 - Open a web browser that allows chrome-like extentions
 - Load the unpacked extention (i.e. the project directory)
 - Navigate to the extentions options to set your default search site
 - Use the `ALT+SHIFT+R` hotkeys to quickly open the seach window
 - Profit!
